		Serenity is the greatest person in the world, and that will never change no matter the circumstance or situation. I will always see her as perfect and as the person I want to be with for the rest of my life. I honestly don't believe that she knows half of what she does for me. There may come times where I'm sad because I can't see her for more than a week at a time; however, she always finds the exact words to make me happy again... even if it takes a little time. Sure, sometimes I may be dense, and not soak in what she says, but she's smart and she always finds a way to make me happy again. She may seem mean sometimes; however, this is only true to people who don't actually care to pay attention to her, but I see her for the real her. People never look past what's at face value, but when I did, I saw something so magnificent and beautiful that I decided to stay for a while; and I'm glad I did. I am so glad, that she can be appreciated, and that I can be that someone to make her the happiest person in the world. She is just too gorgeous for me not to just stand and stare at her for long periods of time. Me and her have a special relationship, and we really are the perfect couple. Although we may belive that we come with what seems like a metric ton of baggage, the other sees it as part of them and has no problem carrying the weight. We believe everything the same, and everything different as needed for the healthiest relationship. She somehow sees me in the same way that I see her, and that kind of relationship can only be expressed in a single word: <br> <br> Harmony
